VarScan v2.4.3 is the current release
VarScan v2.4.0 was the first release to VarScan's new home at GitHub, http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/
VarScan v2.3.9 and prior releases will persist on SourceForge, as will the support forums and other resources.

VERSION 2.4.3 CHANGES
The principal change to this version changes how normal read counts are compiled during somatic mutation calling. 

The remaining changes are minor bugfixes for user-reported issues:

1.) Some warnings printed by default to STDOUT (such as "Resetting normal file") are now only reported if --verbose 1 is set.

2.) Added a --min-mmqs-diff parameter to fpfilter, so that users can remove false positives with low/negative MMQSdiff values.

3.) Corrected some archaic code that represented indels like INS-3-ACG in VarScan native output. Native output uses more common
formats (+ACG) to represent the variant allele. 

4.) Fixed the parsing exception errors in VarScan copynumber due to 8-column mpileup files (a correct line has 9 columns).

5.) Added a new option, --max-basequal-diff, to the fpfilter command (default value: 50).


REMINDER: PLEASE USE THE FALSE POSITIVE FILTER (fpfilter)
We recommend processing initial VarScan output with processSomatic, and then applying fpfilter to high-confidence Somatic calls.
Although the "somaticFilter" function will continue to be available, we recommend using the above approach instead.

The scientific basis of this filter is described in the VarScan 2 publication. It will improve
the precision of variant and mutation calling by removing artifacts associated with short-read alignment.
-For somatic mutations, generate bam-readcounts with the Tumor BAM. For LOH and Germline, generate readcounts with the Normal BAM
-For de novo mutations (trio calling), generate readcounts with the child BAM.
The filter requires the bam-readcount utility: https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount

USAGE: java -jar VarScan.jar fpfilter [variant file] [readcount file] OPTIONS
	variant file - A file of SNPs or indels in VarScan-native or VCF format
	readcount file - The output file from bam-readcount for those positions
	***For detailed filtering instructions, please visit http://varscan.sourceforge.net***

	OPTIONS:
	--output-file		Optional output file for filter-pass variants
	--filtered-file		Optional output file for filter-fail variants
	--dream3-settings	If set to 1, optimizes filter parameters based on TCGA-ICGC DREAM-3 SNV Challenge results
	--keep-failures		If set to 1, includes failures in the output file

DREAM-3 SETTINGS FOR FPFILTER
Please note the --dream3-settings parameter for fpfilter, which (if set to 1) will optimize the 
false positive filter settings based on the fine-tuning we did for the TCGA-ICGC DREAM-3 
SNV Challenge. See the "in silico 3" dataset described here:
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn312572/wiki/62018
This dataset modeled 100% tumor purity, but three subclones at 50%, 33%, and 20% variant allele frequency.
Optimal VarScan settings were established as follows:
	For SAMtools:
		mpileup -B (disables BAQ)

	For VarScan somatic:
		--min-coverage 3 --min-var-freq 0.08 --p-value 0.10 --somatic-p-value 0.05 --strand-filter 0

	For VarScan fpfilter:
		--min-var-count = 3
		--min-var-count-lc = 1
		--min-strandedness = 0
		--min-var-basequal = 30
		--min-ref-readpos = 0.20
		--min-ref-dist3 = 0.20
		--min-var-readpos = 0.15
		--min-var-dist3 = 0.15
		--max-rl-diff = 0.05
		--max-mapqual-diff = 10
		--min-ref-mapqual = 20
		--min-var-mapqual = 30
		--max-var-mmqs = 100
		--max-ref-mmqs = 50
